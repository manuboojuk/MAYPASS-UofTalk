
# K-means Matching Algorithm #

- This directory has code related to K-means model creation and random cluster data generation

- Collect sample data from reddit
    - Make a google form to get data from UofT students and other reddit users

- Run 3-different K-means models on this sample with k=3, 9, 15

- Store the models on disk

- Whenever a new user joins, add them to the database with a attribute that assigns them to a cluster for each model (using model.predict)
