## Unfinished Tasks

We did not complete MAYP-9, but since there was no progress on it, we moved it back to the backlog for sprint 4. To ensure steady progress, we replace this user story with MAYP-21, which is implemented a Spotify integration with our app.

## Practices to continue

- Continue to assign tasks based on each persons strengths
- Continue to schedule the meeting dates at the start of the sprint to give everyone a chance to plan their personal schedules around the meetings
- Divide the team into subgroups to allow ideas to be bounced between members
- Have standup meetings every alternating day
- Have a guideline for documentation and branch names/commit messages
- Ensure steady progress is made during the sprint so the demo/deliverable is not rushed
- Make sure every member gets the chance to make a pull request
- Plan out all user stories and subtasks before starting the sprint
- Ensure smaller user stories are merged and all user stories are as atomic as possible

## New practices

- Avoid rescheduling meetings often and sticking to the original meeting schedule planned out in the sprint plan meeting
- Avoid large code overhauls by planning ahead and sketching out design decisions

## Harmful Practices

- Rescheduling meetings often due to other time commitments
- Needing to do large code overhauls at this stage of the development process

## Best/Worst experience in Sprint 3

- Best
	- Learning bootstrap to switch our frontend framework from React to bootstrap 	
	- Setting up attractive UIs for questionaire, meme survey, profile, and the chat pages 
	- Seeing the app come together as a concrete product that supports the full user journey
- Worst
	- Trying to handle assignments along with maintaining progress in sprint 3 
	- Trying to pass the retrieved Spotify data to the flask app using POST requests
