## Unfinished Tasks

We finished all our tasks for sprint 2.

Note that MAYP-15 does not have any progress on GitHub and this is because it was merged with MAYP-5 but kept separate in Jira for tracking purposes.

## Practices to continue

- Continue to assign tasks based on each persons strengths
- Continue to schedule the meeting dates at the start of the sprint to give everyone a chance to plan their personal schedules around the meetings
- Divide the team into subgroups to allow ideas to be bounced between members
- Continue to have standup meetings every alternating day
- Having a guideline for documentation and branch names/commit messages

## New practices

- Ensure steady progress is made during the sprint so the demo/deliverable is not rushed
- Ensure strict guidelines are followed for Jira issues, pull requests, and documentation
- Ensure smaller user stories are merged and all user stories are as atomic as possible
- Make sure every member gets the chance to make a pull request
- Completely plan out all user stories and subtasks before starting the sprint

## Harmful Practices

- Not combining similar user stories into one user story
- Adding large user stories after the sprint had started, causes spikes in the burn-down chart

## Best/Worst experience in sprint 2

- Best
	- Getting the registration system to work by sending automated emails
	- Setting up attractive UIs for the login/registration and survey pages
- Worst
	- Trying to handle studying for midterms and working on sprint 2 at the same time
