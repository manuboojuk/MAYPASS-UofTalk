## Unfinished Tasks

The project is complete and is considered done based on the description in "done.md".

## Practices to continue

- Continue to assign tasks based on each persons strengths
- Continue to schedule the meeting dates at the start of the sprint to give everyone a chance to plan their personal schedules around the meetings
- Divide the team into subgroups to allow ideas to be bounced between members
- Have standup meetings every alternating day
- Have a guideline for documentation and branch names/commit messages
- Ensure steady progress is made during the sprint so the demo/deliverable is not rushed
- Make sure every member gets the chance to make a pull request
- Plan out all user stories and subtasks before starting the sprint
- Ensure smaller user stories are merged and all user stories are as atomic as possible

## New practices

- Finish tasks early so we can focus on deployment

## Harmful Practices

- There were none this sprint and we complete the sprint with best practices in mind

## Best/Worst experience in Sprint 4

- Best
	- Seeing the app come together as a concrete product that supports the full user journey
	- The spotify integration with the app is very impressive and we were all taken away by it
- Worst
	- Trying to handle assignments along with maintaining progress in sprint 4
	- Fixing bugs that could have hindered the presentation
