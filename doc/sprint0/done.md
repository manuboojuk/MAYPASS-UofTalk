## Standard Done ##

- The user can sign-up for an account using their UofT email
- When the user logs in for the first time, they will be prompted to fill out a questionnaire that evaluates their personality, media preferences (music, movies, games, etc…) to build an understanding of their interests
- After this, the user will be shows a standardized set of memes that they rate to evaluate their sense of humour
- Using the above two points, we match them up with other users or groups that share similar interests and humour as them
- These matches will be presented as a list to them (separate list for users and groups that they matched with) and they can click on a user/group to join it
- Once joined, the user will be able to open its chat and send/receive messages
- The user can block another user or leave a group if they choose to do so
- The user can also start a group that initially only contains themselves and other users would be able to join this group if they share similar interests with the member(s) of this group
- The user can log out at any time

## Additional Done ##

- Users can write a short bio and choose between a set of pictures as their avatar (from a set of predefined avatars)
- Upon starting a new conversation with a user or joining a group, a email notification is sent to that user, or to the members of the group
- If a message is sent to a user/group when there hasn’t been any activity for a long time, an email notification is sent out about the message
- To ease the process of evaluating the users interests, we integrate Spotify, YouTube, Steam, Netflix into the app where the user can login to the service and the app pulls relevant information from their profile
- Make the website look nice, through the layout, colours, and etc
