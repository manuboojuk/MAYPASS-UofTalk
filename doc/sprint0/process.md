## How did we organize our team? ##

- All the meetings took place over Discord as it allowed for easy media and screen sharing
- We all contributed to the planning phase of the project and agreed to split the user stories based on each other's strengths and knowledge surrounding the domain.
- The deliverables for sprint0 were prepared collaboratively on a Google Doc where one person typed and the others provided ideas/feedback. 
- We all contribute to tasks equally and so we all pretty much do similar jobs (i.e no one as any special role or special task to do) so our roles are all the same; we all play the role of “software developers” for this project

## How did we make decisions? ##

- Decisions were made during meetings that were scheduled early in advance to ensure everyone had a chance to prepare.
- Everyone had the opportunity to voice their opinion during our meetings and we made the decision that everyone was comfortable with.

## How did we define priority and/or points of user stories? ##

- We are planning on using ‘planning poker’ and a fibonacci scale.
- Every team member has to discuss the points given to each user story and we will all have to agree on the scoring after we converge on a score.
    - Non-convergent user stories will be broken down into smaller user stories OR will be assigned to multiple people

## How frequently did we meet? ##

- We met 3 times during the first week of sprint0 for icebreakers, potential ideas for the project and brainstorming
    - Days: Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday
- During the 2nd week of sprint0, we finalized the project idea and met more frequently to complete all the deliverables and documentation by the deadline
    - Days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday

## What lessons should we take forward to the next phase? ##

- Schedule the meeting dates at the start of the sprint to give everyone a chance to plan their personal schedules around the meetings
- Emergency meetings can be called by any member but should be done sparingly
Tasks that can be done individually should be done independently as opposed to bringing in the entire group to complete it
- This will increase team efficiency
