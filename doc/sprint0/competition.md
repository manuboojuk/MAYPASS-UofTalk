### Tinder ###
Tinder is more focused on users trying to find romantic partners, while our app is about finding platonic relationships
Our app is more focused on connecting UofT students, while Tinder is much more broad with respect to the people whom you could connect with
Our app matches people with similar interests and senses of humour, while Tinder lets the user select who they want to connect with
Our app Allows for students to find friend groups while Tinder just connects you to individual people
UofT students can use Tinder to achieve a similar result, but this can be extremely hard or difficult on this platform

### Discord ###
Discord share similar features to our app in related to messaging and groups but Our app is different in the sense that it finds like-minded users for you rather than leaving it open to you to find groups/servers
In order for them to implement this as of now, they would need all the users to add interests to their profile and also ask users for permission to be paired with other users/groups
Some users may participate, but most users will not, making discord unlikely to be a competitor to us in the near future

### Facebook ###
Facebook is the most similar to our app where it has an algorithm that does some sort of pairing based on user interests (that they selected when signing up)
It also allows for users to create and manage groups
Although Facebook has these features, our app is on a smaller scale and targeted towards UofT student only
This allows for pairing to be more focused and targeted, as opposed the broader scale that Facebook operated on
Additionally, our pairing algorithm uses relevant categories and focused towards a younger university student audience which allows the pairings to more accurate

----------

Discord and Facebook give the closest functionality of our app, but our app is more focused on automating the pairing process and operating on a smaller network scale (just UofT students). The pairing is also done using more relevant categories and is more targeted towards a younger student audience.
